# bingbot
Fun little Discord bot using .NET to make cool/fun stuff for my friends ðŸ˜¸

## Running Locally
For the bot to connect to a voice channel and send audio *in local development*, you will need the following (note that this isn't necessary for a deployed env using Docker)
  * `libsodium` and `opus` - https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net/blob/dev/voice-natives/vnext_natives_win32_x64.zip
    * Extract `libsodium.dll` and `libopus.dll` from the above download
    * Rename `libopus.dll` to `opus.dll`
    * Move both to where the application is being run from (ex. `./bin/Debug/net6.0`)
  * `ffmpeg` - https://ffmpeg.org/download.html

## DiscordNET
This project uses DiscordNET's [interaction framework](https://discordnet.dev/guides/int_framework/intro.html) for handling commands

Commands are organized into modules which are found in the `Modules` directory. Within a module you can create commands and sub-commands

The interaction framework handles automatically creating/updating/deleting commands on the server(s) when the bot starts
